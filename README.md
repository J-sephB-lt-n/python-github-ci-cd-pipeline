# python-github-ci-pipeline
Example [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) pipeline for a python project using GitHub actions and GitHub branch protection.

The project code consists of a toy implementation of the original [Diffie-Hellman-Merkle Key Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffieâ€“Hellman_key_exchange) algorithm (which is used to securely communicate a secret key across an insecure public communication channel).

Implemented so far:

| Task                        | Location                | How to Run This Task
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------
| Auto-format all code scripts (uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)) | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make auto_format_code</code>
| Auto-format all code scripts (uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)) | remote github repo      | task runs automatically (using github action) whenever code is pushed to remote main branch
| Install development dependencies (required to run tests, build documentation etc.) | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make install_dev_dependencies</code>
| Install production dependencies (required to use the package) | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make install_prod_dependencies</code>
| Measure test coverage (uses [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov)) | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make test_coverage</code>
| Run all tests (unit, integration, end-to-end, test coverage, linter, type-checking) | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make run_all_tests</code>
| Run all tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) | remote github repo | main branch rejects merges not passing all tests 
| Run all unit tests | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make unit_tests</code>
| Run all integration tests | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make integration_tests</code>
| Run all end-to-end tests | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make end_to_end_tests</code>
| Run code linting on core scripts in [/diffie_hellman_merkle/](./diffie_hellman_merkle/) folder (uses [Pylint](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint)) | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make linter</code>
| Run static type checking on core scripts in [/diffie_hellman_merkle/](./diffie_hellman_merkle/) folder (uses [my[py]](https://github.com/python/mypy)) | local github repo | run in terminal (from project root folder):<br> <code>make type_checks</code>

# GitHub Actions and Branch Protection Rules

TODO

# Setup Notes

* In order for GitHub actions to be able to write to the repository (e.g. to automatically format code, and then commit and push the changed code), you need to enable "Read and write permissions" for GitHub actions in the GitHub website UI (this is under *Settings>>Actions>>General*).

# Other Notes

* Remote rejections can be pre-empted by developers using [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) locally, which will cause commits of insufficient quality (e.g. mypy errors, pylint score too low etc.) to be rejected locally when a local <code>git commit</code> is attempted (i.e. before attempting communication with the remote github repository). However, this puts the onus on individual developers to be principled with their local environment, which is why I used GitHub branch protection rules on the remote repository instead (so that the remote main branch is automatically protected).
